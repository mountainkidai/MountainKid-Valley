# MountainKid Valley 2030

## **Introduction**

MountainKid Valley 2030 is not just a dream—It’s a responsible calculated engineering project for a brighter, sustainable future of Himachal & the world as the next tech valley where you see the intersection of Inventions/ Innovations, Engineering and Arts. 


It is transformative initiative led by **AlpKid Capital Private Limited** with the mission of transitioning Himachal Pradesh from a tourism-based economy to a startup-driven economy by 2030. This ambitious project addresses critical issues such as youth emigration, environmental degradation, lack of education and skills, and the growing disconnect between traditional and modern development approaches.

## **The Origin of MountainKid Valley**

I was 17 when I realized that real life is living a long life in a short time rather than living a short life in a long time. By 20, I had 6 startup failures and had given up on life to become a monk in Kullu. And while working as a cleaner/Telecaller in a travel company for Rs.2000/- salary a month,I realized that becoming a monk at 20 is accepting failure, and in 5 years, I built myself from scratch and after starting TMK (TheMountainKid) Cafe in Summerhill (2022), it was clear to me that only Engineering and Youth can save the future of Himachal and this beautiful nature now.  That's how MountainKid started with Rs.600 and sheer passion to build something impactful.

Though I was born and raised in Andhra Pradesh, My time in the fields with my grandfather and his books has taught me that Nature is God and Engineering is the best reward in life that one could ever get. Perhaps that could be the reason why I am always intrigued to see nature growing up. And that’s how MountainKid name evolved (a real Phadi is the one who sees life/God in Nature)

 ## **What actually MountainKid wants to solve?**

 
Here are some of the questions I have after seeing Himachal in the last 5 years:
At this pace of landslides,Will this natural beauty survive another decade?
With young people leaving for better opportunities, what will Himachal look like in the next 10 years?
 Can we balance tourism with preserving Himachal's environment?
How can we equip youth with the skills to build their dreams here?
Can we build the next tech valley in Himachal?

 **For a State/Country to thrive, we need:**
1. Education rooted in first principles.
2. Entertainment / Cultural events to improve unity among people.
3. Transparent governance.

**Challenges We Aim to Solve**


Education for everyone to become engineers at thinking.

Support for startups and innovations / Inventions.

Environmental sustainability.

Rural employment and infrastructure.

Nutrition and Healthy food for everybody.

Farming tools for everyone to do organic farming at fingertips.

Modern Tools with AI & Blockchain to run Himachal Tourism and Startup Ecosystem.



## **Vision**

To create a sustainable and thriving Himachal Pradesh by 2030 through innovation, skill development, and community-driven efforts, ensuring:

- **Preservation of natural beauty and ecological balance**.
- **Opportunities for youth** to grow and lead in the startup ecosystem.
- **Development of cutting-edge infrastructure** integrated with sustainable technologies.
- **Inclusive and quality education** rooted in first principles thinking.

## **Why 2030?**
Everything looks great on paper, but reality hits when we implement ideas. 

If Galileo did not take that freedom of creator, by this time, no word of flight might be there as we live in a perception that we will vanish once we cross the edge of the earth.”

If Elon Musk had not taken that freedom of invention, by this time, no word of electric transportation would have been there as we live in a perception that electric vehicles are a myth.

With MountainKid Valley, the reward is either the **biggest failure of all time or the team of a company that transformed a field for the next generation. But the effort will shape Himachal's future**.
